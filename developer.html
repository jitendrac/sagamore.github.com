    <p>Do you dream in parentheses and curly braces? Us too!</p>

    <p>Our system was designed with you in mind. Sagamore Retail comes equipped with a comprehensive REST/JSON API. Though it's accessible from any programming language, our open source Ruby client library makes things even easier (with more languages on the way).</p>

    <p>We also provide a JavaScript API to allow you to develop custom browser-based apps that integrate seamlessly with our built-in UIs.</p>

    <p>Once we're out of private beta, we'll load this page up with API docs and links to our client libraries.</p>
