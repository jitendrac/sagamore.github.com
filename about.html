      <p>Sagamore Retail is a web-based retail platform and application software suite. We founded Sagamore Retail in 2010 after operating a chain of specialty apparel stores in New England for over 15 years, along with an ecommerce website and call center. Unsatisfied with the capabilities of commercial retail software, we decided to build a platform and application suite that could properly support our multi-channel enterprise.</p>
      <p>Sagamore Retail offers a suite of fully integrated applications to manage Point of Sale (POS), Inventory Control, Purchasing and Receiving, Customer/Order Management and Fulfillment, and Reporting.</p>
      <p>Sagamore Retail's platform and applications have powered retailers in production since August 2011. We are currently enrolling customers in our private beta program before our public launch in 2013.</p>
