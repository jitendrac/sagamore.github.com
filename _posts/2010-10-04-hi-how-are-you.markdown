My name is Myke Cameron, and I develop software for
[Slingshot Software](http://slingshotsoftware.com).  
My love of software began when I first discovered the
[QBasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qbasic)
installation hiding on a family friend's laptop, and wrote my first "hello world":

    10 PRINT "HI MYKE!"
    20 GOTO 10

I've always been a tinkerer. I was the kind of kid who'd take apart the VCR if you took your eyes off
of him for a couple of minutes. In software, I found the satisfaction that had eluded me thus far.
Erector sets and electronics kits were fun, but software was different.  With a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)
 and a
floppy drive you bought a flea market, you could make real software that really worked.  I wasn't
playing with toys, I was using real tools.  After upgrading to a Mac LC II with a 9600 baud modem,
the possibilities seemed endless.  The local library's computer science shelves had nothing on the
hundreds of thousands of developers sharing their knowledge and experience on Usenet and the Web.

I think its about time I returned the favor.

So what do I plan on writing about, anyway?  The languages I use daily, Ruby and JavaScript, are
safe bets although lately I've been up to my elbows in .NET and C#, so I wouldn't be surprised if
they come up, as well.   Test driven development, web development, distributed systems and database
design are all likely subjects -- really anything I stumble across during my adventures in coding is
fair game.
