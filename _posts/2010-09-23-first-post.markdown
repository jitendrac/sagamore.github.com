Hi, I’m <a href="http://github.com/jstotz">Jay Stotz</a>. I’m a developer and systems architect for <a href="http://www.slingshotsoftware.com/">Slingshot Software</a>. I was brought on board about two years ago to help extend the footprint of their <a href="http://www.slingshotsoftware.com/content/products">ERP product</a> to include retail applications like <a href="http://www.slingshotsoftware.com/content/products/point-of-sale">Point-of-Sale</a> and e-commerce.

The obligatory personal background:

I started programming computers when I was about 11 years old. At first I would transcribe BASIC programs from books (which I borrowed from the library) onto an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series">Apple IIC</a> (which I found in a box in my grandmother’s basement.) Then I started tweaking and modifying them to suit my will, eventually writing my own from scratch and, well, you’ve probably heard (or lived) this story before. If you’re reading this you’re either as interested in programming as I am or someone is holding a gun to your head and making you read tech blogs

Fast forward a few years and I’m reveling deeply in the glory that is Windows 95. I discover the web, soon realizing that I can not only consume the content but create it. My first brush with HTML. I realize that a lot of the content I want to create is redundant and better delegated to a machine which leads me to PHP (and JavaScript). Turns out if you like running PHP on Windows, you’ll love it on Linux (that’s the sound of a can of worms being opened.) PHP gives way to Ruby (via Rails)...

I’m excited to have the chance to share my experiences with the community and hopefully to get new insight in return. I’m fortunate to work for <a href="http://www.slingshotsoftware.com/">a company</a> that understands the value of contributing to this exchange.

To give you an idea of what this blog is going to be about, here’s a preview of some of the topics I hope to cover in future posts:

<ul>
	<li>HTTP/REST web services (with Ruby and Sinatra)</li>
	<li>Automated software testing (with RSpec and Selenium)</li>
	<li>Distributed version control (with Git)</li>
	<li>The challenges of migrating an existing architecture to multi-tenanted SaaS</li>
	<li>Asynchronous messaging and task processing</li>
	<li>JavaScript &amp; jQuery</li>
	<li>Software project management practices and processes</li>
	<li>System monitoring and fault tolerance</li>
</ul>
