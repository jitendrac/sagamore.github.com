			<h3>In the Pink Stores</h3>
			<p>"We went live on Sagamore Retail at the end of our 2011 season and the past 12 months have been the most successful in the history of the company! I love being able to look at real time data on my iPad when I am running between stores. This helps me maximize sales in all stores. Sagamore Retail is truly incredible."</p>

			<h3>Patricia Adams Gifts</h3>
			<p>"We opened our store on a holiday weekend and implemented Sagamore Retail the same day. The support was outstanding. Phone calls were returned at a moment's notice on Saturday, Sunday and Labor Day. Sagamore Retail is user friendly â€” part-timers to the most experienced retail staff find the system easy to use!"</p>
